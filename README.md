# Diagram Maker Project

This project demonstrates the use of various modern web technologies and concepts to create a diagram maker application.

## Technologies and Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
2. **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
3. **Mermaid**: A JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create diagrams.
4. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
5. **Cloudflare Workers**: A serverless execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

## Components

- `DiagramControls.jsx`: Likely contains UI controls for manipulating diagrams.
- `DiagramRenderer.jsx`: Probably responsible for rendering the diagrams.
- `MermaidRenderer.jsx`: Specifically handles the rendering of Mermaid diagrams.

## Key Features

- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Client-side interactivity with React
- Diagram creation and rendering using Mermaid
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- API routing (placeholder in `_worker.js`)
- Static asset serving via Cloudflare Workers

## Configuration

- Custom webpack configuration in `next.config.js`
- PostCSS and Tailwind CSS configuration

This project serves as a comprehensive example of integrating various modern web technologies to create a functional and interactive diagram maker application.
